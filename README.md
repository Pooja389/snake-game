# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game built using Python's `turtle` module. The game includes features such as tracking the highest score and interactive gameplay with user input.

## Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake moves around, eating food to grow longer.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the current score and the highest score across sessions.
- **Game Controls**:
  - Arrow keys for navigation:
    - Up: Move up
    - Down: Move down
    - Left: Move left
    - Right: Move right
- **Replay Option**: Option to play again when the game is over.

## How to Play
1. The snake starts in the center of the game screen.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
3. Eat the red food to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
5. If the game ends, you'll be prompted to play again or exit.

- Turtle module (comes pre-installed with Python)
- A `my_file.txt` file to store the highest score:
